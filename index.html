          <h3>Sonic Surfer(2020)</h3>
          <p>Sonic Surfer is a multimedia game inspired
            early iphone-games such as temple run and flappy bird. The
            game is controled thorugh a pressure senstive pad that the
            player stands on. Sonic Surfer relies primarily on spatial audio
            information encoded for a pair of headphones. The user leans towards
            "good" sounds and avoids the bad "ones".</p>

          <h3>Feedback(2020)</h3>
          <p>Feedback is a multimodal instrument inspired by the electro-acoustic
            phenomenon, feedback. This instrument uses gloves with embedded light sensors
            to control audio synthesis and subsequently control a 2D animation. The user
            then uses this animation to excite the gloves sensors.
